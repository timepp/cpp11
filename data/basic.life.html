<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>The properties ascribed to objects throughout this International Standard apply for a given object only during
its lifetime. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> In particular, before the lifetime of an object starts and after its lifetime ends there are
significant restrictions on the use of the object, as described below, in <a title="class.base.init" href="class.base.init.html">12.6.2</a> and in <a title="class.cdtor" href="class.cdtor.html">12.7</a>.
Also, the behavior of an object under construction and destruction might not be the same as the behavior of an object
whose lifetime has started and not ended. <a title="class.base.init" href="class.base.init.html">12.6.2</a> and <a title="class.cdtor" href="class.cdtor.html">12.7</a> describe the behavior of objects during
the construction and destruction phases. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p4" href="#p4">4</a>A program may end the lifetime of any object by reusing the storage which the object occupies or by explicitly
calling the destructor for an object of a class type with a non-trivial destructor. For an object of a class type with a
non-trivial destructor, the program is not required to call the destructor explicitly before the storage which the
object occupies is reused or released; however, if there is no explicit call to the destructor or if a
<i class="nonterminal">delete-expression</i> (<a title="expr.delete" href="expr.delete.html">5.3.5</a>) is not used to release the storage, the destructor shall not be implicitly
called and any program that depends on the side effects produced by the destructor has undefined behavior.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p5" href="#p5">5</a>Before the lifetime of an object has started but after the storage which the object will occupy has been
allocated<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn38">38</a></sup> or, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage which the object occupied
is reused or released, any pointer that refers to the storage location where the object will be or was located may be
used but only in limited ways. For an object under construction or destruction, see <a title="class.cdtor" href="class.cdtor.html">12.7</a>.
Otherwise, such a pointer refers to allocated storage (<a title="basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation" href="basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation.html">3.7.4.2</a>), and using the pointer as
if the pointer were of type <code class="sh_cpp">void*</code>, is well-defined. Such a pointer may be dereferenced but the resulting
lvalue may only be used in limited ways, as described below. The program has undefined behavior if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the object will be or was of a class type with a non-trivial destructor and the pointer is used as the operand of a
	<i class="nonterminal">delete-expression</i>,</li>
<li>the pointer is used to access a non-static data member or call a non-static member function of the object, or</li>
<li>the pointer is implicitly converted (<a title="conv.ptr" href="conv.ptr.html">4.10</a>) to a pointer to a base class type, or</li>
<li>the pointer is used as the operand of a <code class="sh_cpp">static_cast</code> (<a title="expr.static.cast" href="expr.static.cast.html">5.2.9</a>) (except when the conversion is

<p><a class="anchor" id="p7" href="#p7">7</a>If, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage which the object occupied is reused or

the original object, a reference that referred to the original object, or the name of the original object will
automatically refer to the new object and, once the lifetime of the new object has started, can be used to manipulate
the new object, if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the storage for the new object exactly overlays the storage location which the original object occupied, and</li>
<li>the new object is of the same type as the original object (ignoring the top-level cv-qualifiers), and</li>
<li>the type of the original object is not const-qualified, and, if a class type, does not contain any non-static data
	member whose type is const-qualified or a reference type, and</li>
<li>the original object was a most derived object (<a title="intro.object" href="intro.object.html">1.8</a>) of type <code class="sh_cpp">T</code> and the new object is a most
