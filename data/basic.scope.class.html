<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>The following rules describe the scope of names declared in classes.</p>

<ol>
<li>The potential scope of a name declared in a class consists not only of the declarative region following the name’s
	point of declaration, but also of all function bodies, <i class="nonterminal">brace-or-equal-initializers</i> of non-static data members,
	and default arguments in that class (including such things in nested classes).</li>
<li>A name <code class="sh_cpp">N</code> used in a class <code class="sh_cpp">S</code> shall refer to the same declaration in its context and when re-evaluated in
	the completed scope of <code class="sh_cpp">S</code>. No diagnostic is required for a violation of this rule.</li>
<li>If reordering member declarations in a class yields an alternate valid program under (1) and (2), the
	program is ill-formed, no diagnostic is required.</li>
<li>A name declared within a member function hides a declaration of the same name whose scope extends
	to or past the end of the member function’s class.</li>
<li>The potential scope of a declaration that extends to or past the end of a class definition also extends to the
regions defined by its member definitions, even if the members are defined lexically outside the class (this includes
static data member definitions, nested class definitions, member function definitions (including the member function
body and any portion of the declarator part of such definitions which follows the <i class="nonterminal">declarator-id</i>, including a
<i class="nonterminal">parameter-declaration-clause</i> and any default arguments (<a title="dcl.fct.default" href="dcl.fct.default.html">8.3.6</a>). <div class="example">
