<dfn class="label">[basic.start.init]</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="[basic.start.init]"></object>3.6.2 Initialization of non-local objects </h3>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>There are two broad classes of named non-local variables: those with static storage duration (<a title="basic.stc.static" href="basic.stc.static.html">3.7.1</a>)
and those with thread storage duration (<a title="basic.stc.thread" href="basic.stc.thread.html">3.7.2</a>). Non-local variables with static storage duration are
initialized as a consequence of program initiation. Non-local variables with thread storage duration are initialized as a
consequence of thread execution. Within each of these phases of initiation, initialization occurs as follows.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>Variables with static storage duration (<a title="basic.stc.static" href="basic.stc.static.html">3.7.1</a>) or thread storage duration (<a title="basic.stc.thread" href="basic.stc.thread.html">3.7.2</a>) shall be
zero-initialized (<a title="dcl.init" href="dcl.init.html">8.5</a>) before any other initialization takes place.</p>

<p><dfn>Constant initialization</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="Constant initialization"></object> is performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>if each full-expression (including implicit conversions) that appears in the initializer of a reference with static
	or thread storage duration is a constant expression (<a title="expr.const" href="expr.const.html">5.19</a>) and the reference is bound to an lvalue
	designating an object with static storage duration or to a temporary (see <a title="class.temporary" href="class.temporary.html">12.2</a>)</li>
<li>if an object with static or thread storage duration is initialized by a constructor call, if the constructor is a
	<code class="sh_cpp">constexpr</code> constructor, if all constructor arguments are constant expressions (including conversions),
	and if, after function invocation substitution (<a title="dcl.constexpr" href="dcl.constexpr.html">7.1.5</a>), every constructor call and full-expression in the
	<i class="nonterminal">mem-initializer</i>s and in the <i class="nonterminal">brace-or-equal-initializer</i>s for non-static data members is a constant
	expression;</li>
<li>if an object with static or thread storage duration is not initialized by a constructor call and if every
	full-expression that appears in its initializer is a constant expression.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, zero-initialization and constant initialization are called <dfn>static initialization</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="static initialization"></object>; all other
initialization is <dfn>dynamic initialization</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="dynamic initialization"></object>. Static initialization shall be performed before any dynamic
initialization takes place. Dynamic initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration is either ordered
or unordered. Definitions of explicitly specialized class template static data members have ordered initialization.
Other class template static data members (i.e., implicitly or explicitly instantiated specializations) have unordered
initialization. Other non-local variables with static storage duration have ordered initialization. Variables with ordered
initialization defined within a single translation unit shall be initialized in the order of their definitions in the
translation unit. If a program starts a thread (<a title="thread.threads" href="thread.threads.html">30.3</a>), the subsequent initialization of a variable is
unsequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable defined in a different translation unit. Otherwise, the
initialization of a variable is indeterminately sequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable defined in a
different translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent unordered initialization of a variable is
unsequenced with respect to every other dynamic initialization. Otherwise, the unordered initialization of a variable is
indeterminately sequenced with respect to every other dynamic initialization. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> This definition permits
initialization of a sequence of ordered variables concurrently with another sequence. — <em>end note</em> ]</span> <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> The initialization of
local static variables is described in <a title="stmt.dcl" href="stmt.dcl.html">6.7</a>. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>An implementation is permitted to perform the initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration
as a static initialization even if such initialization is not required to be done statically, provided that</p>
<ul>
<li>the dynamic version of the initialization does not change the value of any other object of namespace scope prior to
	its initialization, and</li>
<li>the static version of the initialization produces the same value in the initialized variable as would be produced by
	the dynamic initialization if all variables not required to be initialized statically were initialized
	dynamically.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p>[ <em>Note:</em> As a consequence, if the initialization of an object <code class="sh_cpp">obj1</code> refers to an object <code class="sh_cpp">obj2</code> of
namespace scope potentially requiring dynamic initialization and defined later in the same translation unit, it is
unspecified whether the value of <code class="sh_cpp">obj2</code> used will be the value of the fully initialized <code class="sh_cpp">obj2</code>
(because <code class="sh_cpp">obj2</code> was statically initialized) or will be the value of <code class="sh_cpp">obj2</code> merely
zero-initialized. For example,</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">inline double fd() { return 1.0; }
extern double d1;
double d2 = d1;         // unspecified:
                        // may be statically initialized to 0.0 or
                        // dynamically initialized to 0.0 if d1 is
                        // dynamically initialized, or 1.0 otherwise
double d1 = fd();       // may be initialized statically or dynamically to 1.0</code></pre>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p4" href="#p4">4</a>It is implementation-defined whether the dynamic initialization of a non-local variable with static storage
duration is done before the first statement of <code class="sh_cpp">main</code>. If the initialization is deferred to some point in
time after the first statement of <code class="sh_cpp">main</code>, it shall occur before the first odr-use (<a title="basic.def.odr" href="basic.def.odr.html">3.2</a>) of any
function or variable defined in the same translation unit as the variable to be initialized.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn34">34</a></sup></p>
