<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>Destructors (<a title="class.dtor" href="class.dtor.html">12.4</a>) for initialized objects (that is, objects whose lifetime (<a title="basic.life" href="basic.life.html">3.8</a>) has
begun) with static storage duration are called as a result of returning from <code class="sh_cpp">main</code> and as a result of
calling <code class="sh_cpp">std::exit</code> (<a title="support.start.term" href="support.start.term.html">18.5</a>). Destructors for initialized objects with thread storage duration
within a given thread are called as a result of returning from the initial function of that thread and as a result of
that thread calling <code class="sh_cpp">std::exit</code>. The completions of the destructors for all initialized objects with thread
storage duration within that thread are sequenced before the initiation of the destructors of any object with static
storage duration. If the completion of the constructor or dynamic initialization of an object with thread storage
duration is sequenced before that of another, the completion of the destructor of the second is sequenced before the
initiation of the destructor of the first. If the completion of the constructor or dynamic initialization of an object
with static storage duration is sequenced before that of another, the completion of the destructor of the second is
sequenced before the initiation of the destructor of the first. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> This definition permits concurrent
destruction. — <em>end note</em> ]</span> If an object is initialized statically, the object is destroyed in the same order as if the object
was dynamically initialized. For an object of array or class type, all subobjects of that object are destroyed before
any block-scope object with static storage duration initialized during the construction of the subobjects is destroyed.
If the destruction of an object with static or thread storage duration exits via an exception,
<code class="sh_cpp">std::terminate</code> is called (<a title="except.terminate" href="except.terminate.html">15.5.1</a>).</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>If a function contains a block-scope object of static or thread storage duration that has been destroyed and the
function is called during the destruction of an object with static or thread storage duration, the program has undefined
behavior if the flow of control passes through the definition of the previously destroyed block-scope object. Likewise, the
behavior is undefined if the block-scope object is used indirectly (i.e., through a pointer) after its
destruction.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>If the completion of the initialization of an object with static storage duration is sequenced before
a call to <code class="sh_cpp">std::atexit</code> (see <code class="header">&lt;cstdlib&gt;</code>, <a title="support.start.term" href="support.start.term.html">18.5</a>), the call to the function passed
to <code class="sh_cpp">std::atexit</code> is sequenced before the call to the destructor for the object. If a call to
<code class="sh_cpp">std::atexit</code> is sequenced before the completion of the initialization of an object with static
storage duration, the call to the destructor for the object is sequenced before the call to the function passed to
<code class="sh_cpp">std::atexit</code>. If a call to <code class="sh_cpp">std::atexit</code> is sequenced before another call to
<code class="sh_cpp">std::atexit</code>, the call to the function passed to the second <code class="sh_cpp">std::atexit</code> call is sequenced
before the call to the function passed to the first <code class="sh_cpp">std::atexit</code> call.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p4" href="#p4">4</a>If there is a use of a standard library object or function not permitted within signal handlers
(<a title="support.runtime" href="support.runtime.html">18.10</a>) that does not happen before (<a title="intro.multithread" href="intro.multithread.html">1.10</a>) completion of destruction of objects with static
storage duration and execution of <code class="sh_cpp">std::atexit</code> registered functions (<a title="support.start.term" href="support.start.term.html">18.5</a>), the program has
undefined behavior. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> If there is a use of an object with static storage duration that does not happen before the
object’s destruction, the program has undefined behavior. Terminating every thread before a call to
<code class="sh_cpp">std::exit</code> or the exit from <code class="sh_cpp">main</code> is sufficient, but not necessary, to satisfy these
requirements. These requirements permit thread managers as static-storage-duration objects. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p5" href="#p5">5</a>Calling the function <code class="sh_cpp">std::abort()</code> declared in <code class="header">&lt;cstdlib&gt;</code> terminates the program without
executing any destructors and without calling the functions passed to <code class="sh_cpp">std::atexit()</code> or
