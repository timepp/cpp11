<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>If a class is declared to be a base class (Clause <a title="class.derived" href="class.derived.html">10</a>) for another class using the
<code class="sh_cpp">public</code> access specifier, the <code class="sh_cpp">public</code> members of the base class are accessible as

the <code class="sh_cpp">protected</code> access specifier, the <code class="sh_cpp">public</code> and <code class="sh_cpp">protected</code> members of the base
class are accessible as <code class="sh_cpp">protected</code> members of the derived class. If a class is declared to be a base class
for another class using the <code class="sh_cpp">private</code> access specifier, the <code class="sh_cpp">public</code> and <code class="sh_cpp">protected</code>
members of the base class are accessible as <code class="sh_cpp">private</code> members of the derived class.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn117">117</a></sup></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>In the absence of an <i class="nonterminal">access-specifier</i> for a base class, <code class="sh_cpp">public</code> is assumed when the

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>[ <em>Note:</em> A member of a private base class might be inaccessible as an inherited member name, but accessible
directly. Because of the rules on pointer conversions (<a title="conv.ptr" href="conv.ptr.html">4.10</a>) and explicit casts (<a title="expr.cast" href="expr.cast.html">5.4</a>), a
conversion from a pointer to a derived class to a pointer to an inaccessible base class might be ill-formed if an
implicit conversion is used, but well-formed if an explicit cast is used. For example,</p>
