<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>Temporaries of class type are created in various contexts: binding a reference to a prvalue (<a title="dcl.init.ref" href="dcl.init.ref.html">8.5.3</a>),
returning a prvalue (<a title="stmt.return" href="stmt.return.html">6.6.3</a>), a conversion that creates a prvalue (<a title="conv.lval" href="conv.lval.html">4.1</a>, <a title="expr.static.cast" href="expr.static.cast.html">5.2.9</a>,
<a title="expr.const.cast" href="expr.const.cast.html">5.2.11</a>, <a title="expr.cast" href="expr.cast.html">5.4</a>), throwing an exception (<a title="except.throw" href="except.throw.html">15.1</a>), entering a <i class="nonterminal">handler</i>
(<a title="except.handle" href="except.handle.html">15.3</a>), and in some initializations (<a title="dcl.init" href="dcl.init.html">8.5</a>). <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> The lifetime of exception objects is described in
<a title="except.throw" href="except.throw.html">15.1</a>. — <em>end note</em> ]</span> Even when the creation of the temporary object is unevaluated (Clause <a title="expr" href="expr.html">5</a>) or otherwise
avoided (<a title="class.copy" href="class.copy.html">12.8</a>), all the semantic restrictions shall be respected as if the temporary object had been created
and later destroyed. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> even if there is no call to the destructor or copy/move constructor, all the semantic

be satisfied. However, in the special case of a function call used as the operand of a <i class="nonterminal">decltype-specifier</i>
(<a title="expr.call" href="expr.call.html">5.2.2</a>), no temporary is introduced, so the foregoing does not apply to the prvalue of any such function
call. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<div class="example">
<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>[ <em>Example:</em> Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">class X {
public:
  X(int);
  X(const X&amp;);
  X&amp; operator=(const X&amp;);
  ~X();
};

class Y {
public:
  Y(int);
  Y(Y&amp;&amp;);
  ~Y();
};

X f(X);
Y g(Y);

void h() {
  X a(1);
  X b = f(X(2));
  Y c = g(Y(3));
  a = f(a);
}</code></pre>

<p>An implementation might use a temporary in which to construct <code class="sh_cpp">X(2)</code> before passing it to <code class="sh_cpp">f()</code>
using <code class="sh_cpp">X</code>’s copy constructor; alternatively, <code class="sh_cpp">X(2)</code> might be constructed in the space used to hold
the argument. Likewise, an implementation might use a temporary in which to construct <code class="sh_cpp">Y(3)</code> before passing
it to <code class="sh_cpp">g()</code> using <code class="sh_cpp">Y</code>’s move constructor; alternatively, <code class="sh_cpp">Y(3)</code> might be constructed in
the space used to hold the argument. Also, a temporary might be used to hold the result of <code class="sh_cpp">f(X(2))</code> before
copying it to <code class="sh_cpp">b</code> using <code class="sh_cpp">X</code>’s copy constructor; alternatively, <code class="sh_cpp">f()</code>’s result might be
constructed in <code class="sh_cpp">b</code>. Likewise, a temporary might be used to hold the result of <code class="sh_cpp">g(Y(3))</code> before
moving it to <code class="sh_cpp">c</code> using <code class="sh_cpp">Y</code>’s move constructor; alternatively, <code class="sh_cpp">g()</code>’s result might be
constructed in <code class="sh_cpp">c</code>. On the other hand, the expression <code class="sh_cpp">a=f(a)</code> requires a temporary for the result
of <code class="sh_cpp">f(a)</code>, which is then assigned to <code class="sh_cpp">a</code>. — <em>end example</em> ]</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>When an implementation introduces a temporary object of a class that has a non-trivial constructor
(<a title="class.ctor" href="class.ctor.html">12.1</a>, <a title="class.copy" href="class.copy.html">12.8</a>), it shall ensure that a constructor is called for the temporary object. Similarly,
the destructor shall be called for a temporary with a non-trivial destructor (<a title="class.dtor" href="class.dtor.html">12.4</a>). Temporary objects are
destroyed as the last step in evaluating the full-expression (<a title="intro.execution" href="intro.execution.html">1.9</a>) that (lexically) contains the point where
they were created. This is true even if that evaluation ends in throwing an exception. The value computations and side
effects of destroying a temporary object are associated only with the full-expression, not with any specific
subexpression.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p4" href="#p4">4</a>There are two contexts in which temporaries are destroyed at a different point than the end of the
full-expression. The first context is when a default constructor is called to initialize an element of an array. If the
constructor has one or more default arguments, the destruction of every temporary created in a default argument
is sequenced before the construction of the next array element, if any.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p5" href="#p5">5</a>The second context is when a reference is bound to a temporary. The temporary to which the reference is bound
or the temporary that is the complete object of a subobject to which the reference is bound persists for the lifetime of
the reference except:</p>

<ul>
<li>A temporary bound to a reference member in a constructor’s ctor-initializer (<a title="class.base.init" href="class.base.init.html">12.6.2</a>) persists until the
	constructor exits.</li>
<li>A temporary bound to a reference parameter in a function call (<a title="expr.call" href="expr.call.html">5.2.2</a>) persists until the completion of
	the full-expression containing the call.</li>
<li>The lifetime of a temporary bound to the returned value in a function return statement (<a title="stmt.return" href="stmt.return.html">6.6.3</a>) is not
	extended; the temporary is destroyed at the end of the full-expression in the return statement.</li>
<li>A temporary bound to a reference in a <i class="nonterminal">new-initializer</i> (<a title="expr.new" href="expr.new.html">5.3.4</a>) persists until the completion of
	the full-expression containing the <i class="nonterminal">new-initializer</i>.

<div class="example">
<p>[ <em>Example:</em> </p>
<pre><code class="sh_cpp">struct S { int mi; const std::pair&lt;int,int&gt;&amp; mp; };
S a { 1, {2,3} };
S* p = new S{ 1, {2,3} };   // Creates dangling reference</code></pre>
<p> — <em>end example</em> ]</p>
</div>

	<span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> This may introduce a dangling reference, and implementations are encouraged to issue a warning in such a
	case. — <em>end note</em> ]</span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The destruction of a temporary whose lifetime is not extended by being bound to a reference is sequenced before the
destruction of every temporary which is constructed earlier in the same full-expression. If the lifetime of two or more
temporaries to which references are bound ends at the same point, these temporaries are destroyed at that point in the
reverse order of the completion of their construction. In addition, the destruction of temporaries bound to references
shall take into account the ordering of destruction of objects with static, thread, or automatic storage duration
(<a title="basic.stc.static" href="basic.stc.static.html">3.7.1</a>, <a title="basic.stc.thread" href="basic.stc.thread.html">3.7.2</a>, <a title="basic.stc.auto" href="basic.stc.auto.html">3.7.3</a>); that is, if <code class="sh_cpp">obj1</code> is an object with the same storage
duration as the temporary and created before the temporary is created the temporary shall be destroyed before
<code class="sh_cpp">obj1</code> is destroyed; if <code class="sh_cpp">obj2</code> is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created after the temporary is created the temporary shall be destroyed after <code class="sh_cpp">obj2</code> is destroyed.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>[ <em>Example:</em> </p>
<pre><code class="sh_cpp">struct S {
  S();
  S(int);
  friend S operator+(const S&amp;, const S&amp;);
  ~S();
};
S obj1;
const S&amp; cr = S(16)+S(23);
S obj2;</code></pre>

<p>the expression <code class="sh_cpp">S(16) + S(23)</code> creates three temporaries: a first temporary <code class="sh_cpp">T1</code> to hold the
result of the expression <code class="sh_cpp">S(16)</code>, a second temporary <code class="sh_cpp">T2</code> to hold the result of the expression
<code class="sh_cpp">S(23)</code>, and a third temporary <code class="sh_cpp">T3</code> to hold the result of the addition of these two expressions.
The temporary <code class="sh_cpp">T3</code> is then bound to the reference <code class="sh_cpp">cr</code>. It is unspecified whether <code class="sh_cpp">T1</code>
or <code class="sh_cpp">T2</code> is created first. On an implementation where <code class="sh_cpp">T1</code> is created before <code class="sh_cpp">T2</code>, it is
guaranteed that <code class="sh_cpp">T2</code> is destroyed before <code class="sh_cpp">T1</code>. The temporaries <code class="sh_cpp">T1</code> and <code class="sh_cpp">T2</code>
are bound to the reference parameters of <code class="sh_cpp">operator+</code>; these temporaries are destroyed at the end of the
full-expression containing the call to <code class="sh_cpp">operator+</code>. The temporary <code class="sh_cpp">T3</code> bound to the reference
<code class="sh_cpp">cr</code> is destroyed at the end of <code class="sh_cpp">cr</code>’s lifetime, that is, at the end of the program. In addition,
the order in which <code class="sh_cpp">T3</code> is destroyed takes into account the destruction order of other objects with static
storage duration. That is, because <code class="sh_cpp">obj1</code> is constructed before <code class="sh_cpp">T3</code>, and <code class="sh_cpp">T3</code> is
constructed before <code class="sh_cpp">obj2</code>, it is guaranteed that <code class="sh_cpp">obj2</code> is destroyed before <code class="sh_cpp">T3</code>, and
that <code class="sh_cpp">T3</code> is destroyed before <code class="sh_cpp">obj1</code>. — <em>end example</em> ]</p>
