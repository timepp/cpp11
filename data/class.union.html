<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>In a union, at most one of the non-static data members can be active at any time, that is, the value of at most
one of the non-static data members can be stored in a union at any time. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> One special guarantee is made in order to
simplify the use of unions: If a standard-layout union contains several standard-layout structs that share a common
initial sequence (<a title="class.mem" href="class.mem.html">9.2</a>), and if an object of this standard-layout union type contains one of the
standard-layout structs, it is permitted to inspect the common initial sequence of any of standard-layout struct
members; see <a title="class.mem" href="class.mem.html">9.2</a>. — <em>end note</em> ]</span> The size of a union is sufficient to contain the largest of its non-static data
members. Each non-static data member is allocated as if it were the sole member of a struct.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>A union can have member functions (including constructors and destructors), but not virtual (<a title="class.virtual" href="class.virtual.html">10.3</a>)
functions. A union shall not have base classes. A union shall not be used as a base class. If a union contains a
non-static data member of reference type the program is ill-formed. At most one non-static data member of a union may
have a <i class="nonterminal">brace-or-equal-initializer</i>. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> If any non-static data member of a union has a non-trivial default
constructor (<a title="class.ctor" href="class.ctor.html">12.1</a>), copy constructor (<a title="class.copy" href="class.copy.html">12.8</a>), move constructor (<a title="class.copy" href="class.copy.html">12.8</a>), copy assignment
operator (<a title="class.copy" href="class.copy.html">12.8</a>), move assignment operator (<a title="class.copy" href="class.copy.html">12.8</a>), or destructor (<a title="class.dtor" href="class.dtor.html">12.4</a>), the
corresponding member function of the union must be user-provided or it will be implicitly deleted (<a title="dcl.fct.def.delete" href="dcl.fct.def.delete.html">8.4.3</a>) for
the union. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<div class="example">
<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>[ <em>Example:</em> Consider the following union:</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">union U {
  int i;

<p>Since <code class="sh_cpp">std::string</code> (<a title="string.classes" href="string.classes.html">21.3</a>) declares non-trivial versions of all of the special member
functions, <code class="sh_cpp">U</code> will have an implicitly deleted default constructor, copy/move constructor, copy/move
assignment operator, and destructor. To use <code class="sh_cpp">U</code>, some or all of these member functions must be
user-provided. — <em>end example</em> ]</p>

<code class="sh_cpp">m</code> of type <code class="sh_cpp">M</code> and <code class="sh_cpp">n</code> of type <code class="sh_cpp">N</code>. If <code class="sh_cpp">M</code> has a non-trivial
destructor and <code class="sh_cpp">N</code> has a non-trivial constructor (for instance, if they declare or inherit virtual
functions), the active member of <code class="sh_cpp">u</code> can be safely switched from <code class="sh_cpp">m</code> to <code class="sh_cpp">n</code> using the

<i class="nonterminal">member-specification</i> of an anonymous union shall only define non-static data members. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> Nested types and
functions cannot be declared within an anonymous union. — <em>end note</em> ]</span> The names of the members of an anonymous union shall be
distinct from the names of any other entity in the scope in which the anonymous union is declared. For the purpose of
name lookup, after the anonymous union definition, the members of the anonymous union are considered to have been
defined in the scope in which the anonymous union is declared.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>[ <em>Example:</em> </p>
<pre><code class="sh_cpp">void f() {
  union { int a; const char* p; };
  a = 1;
  p = "Jennifer";
}</code></pre>

<p>Here <code class="sh_cpp">a</code> and <code class="sh_cpp">p</code> are used like ordinary (nonmember) variables, but since they are union members
they have the same address. — <em>end example</em> ]</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p6" href="#p6">6</a>Anonymous unions declared in a named namespace or in the global namespace shall be declared
<code class="sh_cpp">static</code>. Anonymous unions declared at block scope shall be declared with any storage class allowed for a
block-scope variable, or with no storage class. A storage class is not allowed in a declaration of an anonymous union in
a class scope. An anonymous union shall not have <code class="sh_cpp">private</code> or <code class="sh_cpp">protected</code> members (Clause
<a title="class.access" href="class.access.html">11</a>). An anonymous union shall not have function members.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p7" href="#p7">7</a>A union for which objects or pointers are declared is not an anonymous union.</p>

aa = 1;                 // error
ptr-&gt;aa = 1;            // OK</code></pre>

<p>The assignment to plain <code class="sh_cpp">aa</code> is ill-formed since the member name is not visible outside the union, and
even if it were visible, it is not associated with any particular object. — <em>end example</em> ]</p>
