<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>After all parameters in the replacement list have been substituted and <code class="sh_cpp">#</code> and <code class="sh_cpp">##</code>
processing has taken place, all placemarker preprocessing tokens are removed. Then the resulting preprocessing token
sequence is rescanned, along with all subsequent preprocessing tokens of the source file, for more macro names to
replace.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>If the name of the macro being replaced is found during this scan of the replacement list (not including the
rest of the source file’s preprocessing tokens), it is not replaced. Furthermore, if any nested replacements encounter
the name of the macro being replaced, it is not replaced. These nonreplaced macro name preprocessing tokens are no
longer available for further replacement even if they are later (re)examined in contexts in which that macro name
preprocessing token would otherwise have been replaced.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>The resulting completely macro-replaced preprocessing token sequence is not processed as a preprocessing
directive even if it resembles one, but all pragma unary operator expressions within it are then processed as specified
in <a title="cpp.pragma.op" href="cpp.pragma.op.html">16.9</a> below.</p>
