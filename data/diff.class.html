<title>Clause 9: classes</title>

<h3>
<dfn class="label">[diff.class]</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="[diff.class]"></object>C.1.8 Clause <a title="class" href="class.html">9</a>: classes </h3>

<h4>
<a title="class.name" href="class.name.html">9.1</a> [see also <a title="dcl.typedef" href="dcl.typedef.html">7.1.3</a>]</h4>

<p><strong>Change:</strong> In C++, a class declaration introduces the class name into the scope where it is declared and hides any
object, function or other declaration of that name in an enclosing scope. In C, an inner scope declaration of a struct
tag name never hides the name of an object or function in an outer scope</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">int x[99];
void f() {
  struct x { int a; };
  sizeof(x); /* size of the array in C */
  /* size of the struct in C++ */
}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> This is one of the few incompatibilities between C and C++ that can be attributed to the new C++ name
space definition where a name can be declared as a type and as a non-type in a single scope causing the non-type name to
hide the type name and requiring that the keywords <code class="sh_cpp">class</code>, <code class="sh_cpp">struct</code>, <code class="sh_cpp">union</code> or
<code class="sh_cpp">enum</code> be used to refer to the type name. This new name space definition provides important notational
conveniences to C++ programmers and helps making the use of the user-defined types as similar as possible to the use of
fundamental types. The advantages of the new name space definition were judged to outweigh by far the incompatibility
with C described above.</p>

<p><strong>Effect on original feature:</strong> Change to semantics of well-defined feature.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty of converting:</strong> Semantic transformation. If the hidden name that needs to be accessed is at global scope, the
<code class="sh_cpp">::</code> C++ operator can be used. If the hidden name is at block scope, either the type or the struct tag has to
be renamed.</p>

<p><strong>How widely used:</strong> Seldom.</p>


<h4><a title="class.nest" href="class.nest.html">9.7</a></h4>

<p><strong>Change:</strong> In C++, the name of a nested class is local to its enclosing class. In C the name of the nested class belongs
to the same scope as the name of the outermost enclosing class.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">struct X {
  struct Y { /* … */ } y;
};
struct Y yy;    // valid C, invalid C++</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> C++ classes have member functions which require that classes establish scopes. The C rule would leave
classes as an incomplete scope mechanism which would prevent C++ programmers from maintaining locality within a class. A
coherent set of scope rules for C++ based on the C rule would be very complicated and C++ programmers would be unable to
predict reliably the meanings of nontrivial examples involving nested or local functions.</p>

<p><strong>Effect on original feature:</strong> Change of semantics of well-defined feature.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty of converting:</strong> Semantic transformation. To make the struct type name visible in the scope of
the enclosing struct, the struct tag could be declared in the scope of the enclosing struct, before the enclosing
struct is defined. Example:</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">struct Y;       // struct Y and struct X are at the same scope
struct X {
  struct Y { /* … */ } y;
};</code></pre>

<p>All the definitions of C struct types enclosed in other struct definitions and accessed outside the scope of
the enclosing struct could be exported to the scope of the enclosing struct. Note: this is a consequence of the
difference in scope rules, which is documented in <a title="basic.scope" href="basic.scope.declarative.html">3.3</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How widely used:</strong> Seldom.</p>


<h4><a title="class.nested.type" href="class.nested.type.html">9.9</a></h4>

<p><strong>Change:</strong> In C++, a typedef name may not be redeclared in a class definition after being used in that definition</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">typedef int I;
struct S {
  I i;
  int I;        // valid C, invalid C++
};</code></pre>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> When classes become complicated, allowing such a redefinition after the type has been used can create
confusion for C++ programmers as to what the meaning of <code class="sh_cpp">I</code> really is.</p>

<p><strong>Effect on original feature:</strong> Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty of converting:</strong> Semantic transformation. Either the type or the struct member has to be
renamed.</p>

<p><strong>How widely used:</strong> Seldom.</p>
