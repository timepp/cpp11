<dfn class="label">[diff.stat]</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="[diff.stat]"></object>C.1.5 Clause <a title="stmt.stmt" href="stmt.stmt.html">6</a>: statements </h3>

<h4>
<a title="stmt.switch" href="stmt.switch.html">6.4.2</a>, <a title="stmt.goto" href="stmt.goto.html">6.6.4</a>
</h4>

<p><strong>Change:</strong> It is now invalid to jump past a declaration with explicit or implicit initializer (except across entire
block not entered)</p>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Constructors used in initializers may allocate resources which need to be de-allocated upon leaving the
block. Allowing jump past initializers would require complicated run-time determination of allocation. Furthermore, any
use of the uninitialized object could be a disaster. With this simple compile-time rule, C++ assures that if an
initialized variable is in scope, then it has assuredly been initialized.</p>

<p><strong>Effect on original feature:</strong> Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty of converting:</strong> Semantic transformation.</p>

<p><strong>How widely used:</strong> Seldom.</p>


<h4><a title="stmt.return" href="stmt.return.html">6.6.3</a></h4>

<p><strong>Change:</strong> It is now invalid to return (explicitly or implicitly) from a function which is declared to return a value
without actually returning a value</p>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The caller and callee may assume fairly elaborate return-value mechanisms for the return of class objects.
If some flow paths execute a return without specifying any value, the implementation must embody many more
complications. Besides, promising to return a value of a given type, and then not returning such a value, has always
been recognized to be a questionable practice, tolerated only because very-old C had no distinction between void
functions and int functions.</p>

<p><strong>Effect on original feature:</strong> Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty of converting:</strong> Semantic transformation. Add an appropriate return value to the source code, such as
zero.</p>

<p><strong>How widely used:</strong> Seldom. For several years, many existing C implementations have produced warnings in this
case.</p>
