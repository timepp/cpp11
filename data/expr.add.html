<p>For addition, either both operands shall have arithmetic or unscoped enumeration type, or one operand shall be a
pointer to a completely-defined object type and the other shall have integral or unscoped enumeration type.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>For subtraction, one of the following shall hold:</p>
<ul>
<li>both operands have arithmetic or unscoped enumeration type; or</li>
<li>both operands are pointers to cv-qualified or cv-unqualified versions of the same completely-defined object type;
	or</li>
<li>the left operand is a pointer to a completely-defined object type and the right operand has integral or unscoped
	enumeration type.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>The result of the binary <code class="sh_cpp">+</code> operator is the sum of the operands. The result of the binary
<code class="sh_cpp">-</code> operator is the difference resulting from the subtraction of the second operand from the first.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p4" href="#p4">4</a>For the purposes of these operators, a pointer to a nonarray object behaves the same as a pointer to the first
element of an array of length one with the type of the object as its element type.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p5" href="#p5">5</a>When an expression that has integral type is added to or subtracted from a pointer, the result has the type of
the pointer operand. If the pointer operand points to an element of an array object, and the array is large enough, the
result points to an element offset from the original element such that the difference of the subscripts of the resulting
and original array elements equals the integral expression. In other words, if the expression <code class="sh_cpp">P</code> points to
the <var>i</var>-th element of an array object, the expressions <code class="sh_cpp">(P)+N</code> (equivalently, <code class="sh_cpp">N+(P)</code>)
and <code class="sh_cpp">(P)-N</code> (where <code class="sh_cpp">N</code> has the value <var>n</var>) point to, respectively, the <var>i</var> +
<var>n</var>-th and <var>i</var> − <var>n</var>-th elements of the array object, provided they exist. Moreover, if the
expression <code class="sh_cpp">P</code> points to the last element of an array object, the expression <code class="sh_cpp">(P)+1</code> points one
past the last element of the array object, and if the expression <code class="sh_cpp">Q</code> points one past the last element of an
array object, the expression <code class="sh_cpp">(Q)-1</code> points to the last element of the array object. If both the pointer
operand and the result point to elements of the same array object, or one past the last element of the array object, the
evaluation shall not produce an overflow; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p6" href="#p6">6</a>When two pointers to elements of the same array object are subtracted, the result is the difference of the
subscripts of the two array elements. The type of the result is an implementation-defined signed integral type; this
type shall be the same type that is defined as <code class="sh_cpp">std::ptrdiff_t</code> in the <code class="header">&lt;cstddef&gt;</code> header
(<a title="support.types" href="support.types.html">18.2</a>). As with any other arithmetic overflow, if the result does not fit in the space provided, the behavior
is undefined. In other words, if the expressions <code class="sh_cpp">P</code> and <code class="sh_cpp">Q</code> point to, respectively, the
<var>i</var>-th and <var>j</var>-th elements of an array object, the expression <code class="sh_cpp">(P)-(Q)</code> has the value
<var>i</var> − <var>j</var> provided the value fits in an object of type <code class="sh_cpp">std::ptrdiff_t</code>. Moreover, if the
expression <code class="sh_cpp">P</code> points either to an element of an array object or one past the last element of an array
object, and the expression <code class="sh_cpp">Q</code> points to the last element of the same array object, the expression
<code class="sh_cpp">((Q)+1)-(P)</code> has the same value as <code class="sh_cpp">((Q)-(P))+1</code> and as <code class="sh_cpp">-((P)-((Q)+1))</code>, and has the
value zero if the expression <code class="sh_cpp">P</code> points one past the last element of the array object, even though the
expression <code class="sh_cpp">(Q)+1</code> does not point to an element of the array object. Unless both pointers point to elements
of the same array object, or one past the last element of the array object, the behavior is undefined.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn83">83</a></sup></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p7" href="#p7">7</a>If the value 0 is added to or subtracted from a pointer value, the result compares equal to the original
pointer value. If two pointers point to the same object or both point one past the end of the same array or both are
null, and the two pointers are subtracted, the result compares equal to the value 0 converted to the type
<code class="sh_cpp">std::ptrdiff_t</code>.</p>


<div><div class="footnote" id="fn83">
<p>83) Another way to approach pointer arithmetic is first to convert the pointer(s) to character
pointer(s): In this scheme the integral value of the expression added to or subtracted from the converted pointer is
first multiplied by the size of the object originally pointed to, and the resulting pointer is converted back to the
original type. For pointer subtraction, the result of the difference between the character pointers is similarly divided
by the size of the object originally pointed to.</p>

<p>When viewed in this way, an implementation need only provide one extra byte (which might overlap another object in
the program) just after the end of the object in order to satisfy the “one past the last element”
requirements.</p>
