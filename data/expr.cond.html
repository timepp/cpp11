<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>Conditional expressions group right-to-left. The first expression is contextually converted to
<code class="sh_cpp">bool</code> (Clause <a title="conv" href="conv.html">4</a>). It is evaluated and if it is <code class="sh_cpp">true</code>, the result of the conditional
expression is the value of the second expression, otherwise that of the third expression. Only one of the second and
third expressions is evaluated. Every value computation and side effect associated with the first expression is
sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with the second or third expression.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>If either the second or the third operand has type (possibly cv-qualified) <code class="sh_cpp">void</code>, then the
lvalue-to-rvalue (<a title="conv.lval" href="conv.lval.html">4.1</a>), array-to-pointer (<a title="conv.array" href="conv.array.html">4.2</a>), and function-to-pointer (<a title="conv.func" href="conv.func.html">4.3</a>) standard
conversions are performed on the second and third operands, and one of the following shall hold:</p>
<ul>
<li>The second or the third operand (but not both) is a <i class="nonterminal">throw-expression</i> (<a title="except.throw" href="except.throw.html">15.1</a>); the result is of
	the type of the other and is a prvalue.</li>
<li>Both the second and the third operands have type <code class="sh_cpp">void</code>; the result is of type <code class="sh_cpp">void</code> and is a
	prvalue. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> This includes the case where both operands are <i class="nonterminal">throw-expression</i>s. — <em>end note</em> ]</span>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>Otherwise, if the second and third operand have different types and either has (possibly cv-qualified) class
type, or if both are glvalues of the same value category and the same type except for cv-qualification, an attempt is
made to convert each of those operands to the type of the other. The process for determining whether an operand
expression <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> of type <code class="sh_cpp">T1</code> can be converted to match an operand expression <code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> of
type <code class="sh_cpp">T2</code> is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> is an lvalue: <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> can be converted to match <code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> if <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> can be
	implicitly converted (Clause <a title="conv" href="conv.html">4</a>) to the type “lvalue reference to <code class="sh_cpp">T2</code>”, subject to the
	constraint that in the conversion the reference must bind directly (<a title="dcl.init.ref" href="dcl.init.ref.html">8.5.3</a>) to an lvalue.</li>
<li>If <code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> is an xvalue: <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> can be converted to match <code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> if <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> can be
	implicitly converted to the type “rvalue reference to <code class="sh_cpp">T2</code>”, subject to the constraint that the reference
	must bind directly.</li>
<li>If <code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> is an rvalue or if neither of the conversions above can be done and at least one of the
	operands has (possibly cv-qualified) class type:
	<ul>
	<li>if <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> and <code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> have class type, and the underlying class types are the same or one is a
		base class of the other: <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> can be converted to match <code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> if the class of
		<code class="sh_cpp">T2</code> is the same type as, or a base class of, the class of <code class="sh_cpp">T1</code>, and the cv-qualification
		of <code class="sh_cpp">T2</code> is the same cv-qualification as, or a greater cv-qualification than, the cv-qualification of
		<code class="sh_cpp">T1</code>. If the conversion is applied, <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> is changed to a prvalue of type <code class="sh_cpp">T2</code>
		by copy-initializing a temporary of type <code class="sh_cpp">T2</code> from <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> and using that temporary as the
		converted operand.</li>
	<li>Otherwise (i.e., if <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> or <code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> has a nonclass type, or if they both have class types but
		the underlying classes are not either the same or one a base class of the other): <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> can be
		converted to match <code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> if <code class="sh_cpp">E1</code> can be implicitly converted to the type that expression
		<code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> would have if <code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> were converted to a prvalue (or the type it has, if
		<code class="sh_cpp">E2</code> is a prvalue).</li>
	</ul>
	Using this process, it is determined whether the second operand can be converted to match the third operand, and
	whether the third operand can be converted to match the second operand. If both can be converted, or one can be
	converted but the conversion is ambiguous, the program is ill-formed. If neither can be converted, the operands are
	left unchanged and further checking is performed as described below. If exactly one conversion is possible, that
	conversion is applied to the chosen operand and the converted operand is used in place of the original operand for
	the remainder of this section.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p4" href="#p4">4</a>If the second and third operands are glvalues of the same value category and have the same type, the result is
of that type and value category and it is a bit-field if the second or the third operand is a bit-field, or if both are
bit-fields.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p5" href="#p5">5</a>Otherwise, the result is a prvalue. If the second and third operands do not have the same type, and either has
(possibly cv-qualified) class type, overload resolution is used to determine the conversions (if any) to be applied to
the operands (<a title="over.match.oper" href="over.match.oper.html">13.3.1.2</a>, <a title="over.built" href="over.built.html">13.6</a>). If the overload resolution fails, the program is ill-formed.
Otherwise, the conversions thus determined are applied, and the converted operands are used in place of the original
operands for the remainder of this section.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p6" href="#p6">6</a>Lvalue-to-rvalue (<a title="conv.lval" href="conv.lval.html">4.1</a>), array-to-pointer (<a title="conv.array" href="conv.array.html">4.2</a>), and function-to-pointer (<a title="conv.func" href="conv.func.html">4.3</a>) standard conversions are
performed on the second and third operands. After those conversions, one of the following shall hold:</p>
<ul>
<li>The second and third operands have the same type; the result is of that type. If the operands have class type, the
	result is a prvalue temporary of the result type, which is copy-initialized from either the second operand or the
	third operand depending on the value of the first operand.</li>
<li>The second and third operands have arithmetic or enumeration type; the usual arithmetic conversions are performed to
	bring them to a common type, and the result is of that type.</li>
<li>The second and third operands have pointer type, or one has pointer type and the other is a null pointer constant,
	or both are null pointer constants, at least one of which is non-integral; pointer conversions (<a title="conv.ptr" href="conv.ptr.html">4.10</a>) and
	qualification conversions (<a title="conv.qual" href="conv.qual.html">4.4</a>) are performed to bring them to their composite pointer type
	(<a title="expr.rel" href="expr.rel.html">5.9</a>). The result is of the composite pointer type.</li>
<li>The second and third operands have pointer to member type, or one has pointer to member type and the other is a null
	pointer constant; pointer to member conversions (<a title="conv.mem" href="conv.mem.html">4.11</a>) and qualification conversions (<a title="conv.qual" href="conv.qual.html">4.4</a>) are
	performed to bring them to a common type, whose cv-qualification shall match the cv-qualification of either the
	second or the third operand. The result is of the common type.</li>
