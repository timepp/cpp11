<dfn class="label">[expr.unary.op]</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="[expr.unary.op]"></object>5.3.1 Unary operators </h3>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>The unary <code class="sh_cpp">*</code> operator performs indirection: the expression to which it is applied shall be a
pointer to an object type, or a pointer to a function type and the result is an lvalue referring to the object or
function to which the expression points. If the type of the expression is “pointer to <code class="sh_cpp">T</code>”, the type of the
result is “<code class="sh_cpp">T</code>”. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> a pointer to an incomplete type (other than <var>cv</var> <code class="sh_cpp">void</code>) can be
dereferenced. The lvalue thus obtained can be used in limited ways (to initialize a reference, for example); this lvalue
must not be converted to a prvalue, see <a title="conv.lval" href="conv.lval.html">4.1</a>. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>The result of each of the following unary operators is a prvalue.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>The result of the unary <code class="sh_cpp">&amp;</code> operator is a pointer to its operand. The operand shall be an lvalue
or a <i class="nonterminal">qualified-id</i>. If the operand is a <i class="nonterminal">qualified-id</i> naming a non-static member <code class="sh_cpp">m</code> of some
class <code class="sh_cpp">C</code> with type <code class="sh_cpp">T</code>, the result has type “pointer to member of class <code class="sh_cpp">C</code> of type
<code class="sh_cpp">T</code>” and is a prvalue designating <code class="sh_cpp">C::m</code>. Otherwise, if the type of the expression is
<code class="sh_cpp">T</code>, the result has type “pointer to <code class="sh_cpp">T</code>” and is a prvalue that is the address of the designated
object (<a title="intro.memory" href="intro.memory.html">1.7</a>) or a pointer to the designated function. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> In particular, the address of an object of type
“<var>cv</var> <code class="sh_cpp">T</code>” is “pointer to <var>cv</var> <code class="sh_cpp">T</code>”, with the same cv-qualification. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<div class="example">
<p>[ <em>Example:</em> </p>
<pre><code class="sh_cpp">struct A { int i; };
struct B : A { };
… &amp;B::i …               // has type int A::*</code></pre>
<p> — <em>end example</em> ]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> a pointer to member formed from a <code class="sh_cpp">mutable</code> non-static data member (<a title="dcl.stc" href="dcl.stc.html">7.1.1</a>) does not
reflect the <code class="sh_cpp">mutable</code> specifier associated with the non-static data member. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p4" href="#p4">4</a>A pointer to member is only formed when an explicit <code class="sh_cpp">&amp;</code> is used and its operand is a
<i class="nonterminal">qualified-id</i> not enclosed in parentheses. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> that is, the expression
<code class="sh_cpp">&amp;(<i class="nonterminal">qualified-id</i>)</code>, where the <i class="nonterminal">qualified-id</i> is enclosed in parentheses, does not form an
expression of type “pointer to member”. Neither does <i class="nonterminal">qualified-id</i>, because there is no implicit conversion from
a <i class="nonterminal">qualified-id</i> for a non-static member function to the type “pointer to member function” as there is from an
lvalue of function type to the type “pointer to function” (<a title="conv.func" href="conv.func.html">4.3</a>). Nor is
<code class="sh_cpp">&amp;<i class="nonterminal">unqualified-id</i></code> a pointer to member, even within the scope of the <i class="nonterminal">unqualified-id</i>’s
class. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p5" href="#p5">5</a>The address of an object of incomplete type can be taken, but if the complete type of that object is a class
type that declares <code class="sh_cpp">operator&amp;()</code> as a member function, then the behavior is undefined (and no diagnostic
is required). The operand of <code class="sh_cpp">&amp;</code> shall not be a bit-field.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p6" href="#p6">6</a>The address of an overloaded function (Clause <a title="over" href="over.html">13</a>) can be taken only in a context that uniquely
determines which version of the overloaded function is referred to (see <a title="over.over" href="over.over.html">13.4</a>). <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> since the context might
determine whether the operand is a static or non-static member function, the context can also affect whether the
expression has type “pointer to function” or “pointer to member function”. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p7" href="#p7">7</a>The operand of the unary <code class="sh_cpp">+</code> operator shall have arithmetic, unscoped enumeration, or pointer type
and the result is the value of the argument. Integral promotion is performed on integral or enumeration operands. The
type of the result is the type of the promoted operand.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p8" href="#p8">8</a>The operand of the unary <code class="sh_cpp">-</code> operator shall have arithmetic or unscoped enumeration type and the
result is the negation of its operand. Integral promotion is performed on integral or enumeration operands. The negative
of an unsigned quantity is computed by subtracting its value from 2<sup><var>n</var></sup>, where <var>n</var> is the
number of bits in the promoted operand. The type of the result is the type of the promoted operand.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p9" href="#p9">9</a>The operand of the logical negation operator <code class="sh_cpp">!</code> is contextually converted to <code class="sh_cpp">bool</code>
(Clause <a title="conv" href="conv.html">4</a>); its value is <code class="sh_cpp">true</code> if the converted operand is <code class="sh_cpp">false</code> and
<code class="sh_cpp">false</code> otherwise. The type of the result is <code class="sh_cpp">bool</code>.

</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p10" href="#p10">10</a>The operand of <code class="sh_cpp">~</code> shall have integral or unscoped enumeration type; the result is the one’s
complement of its operand. Integral promotions are performed. The type of the result is the type of the promoted
operand. There is an ambiguity in the <i class="nonterminal">unary-expression</i> <code class="sh_cpp">~X()</code>, where <code class="sh_cpp">X</code> is a
<i class="nonterminal">class-name</i> or <i class="nonterminal">decltype-specifier</i>. The ambiguity is resolved in favor of treating <code class="sh_cpp">~</code> as a
unary complement rather than treating <code class="sh_cpp">~X</code> as referring to a destructor.</p>
