<dfn class="label">[intro.compliance]</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="[intro.compliance]"></object>1.4 Implementation compliance </h2>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>The set of <dfn>diagnosable rules</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="diagnosable rules"></object> consists of all syntactic and semantic rules in this International
Standard except for those rules containing an explicit notation that no diagnostic is required or which are described
as resulting in undefined behavior.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>Although this International Standard states only requirements on C++ implementations, those requirements are
often easier to understand if they are phrased as requirements on programs, parts of programs, or execution of programs.
Such requirements have the following meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a program contains no violations of the rules in this International Standard, a conforming implementation
shall, within its resource limits, accept and correctly execute<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> that program.</li>

<li>If a program contains a violation of any diagnosable rule or an occurrence of a construct described in this Standard
as conditionally-supported when the implementation does not support that construct, a conforming implementation shall
issue at least one diagnostic message.</li>

<li>If a program contains a violation of a rule for which no diagnostic is required, this International Standard places
no requirement on implementations with respect to that program.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>For classes and class templates, the library Clauses specify partial definitions. Private members (Clause
<a title="class.access" href="class.access.html">11</a>) are not specified, but each implementation shall supply them to complete the definitions according to the
description in the library Clauses.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p4" href="#p4">4</a>For functions, function templates, objects, and values, the library Clauses specify declarations.
Implementations shall supply definitions consistent with the descriptions in the library Clauses.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p5" href="#p5">5</a>The names defined in the library have namespace scope (<a title="basic.namespace" href="basic.namespace.html">7.3</a>). A C++ translation unit (<a title="lex.phases" href="lex.phases.html">2.2</a>)
obtains access to these names by including the appropriate standard library header (<a title="cpp.include" href="cpp.include.html">16.2</a>).</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p6" href="#p6">6</a>The templates, classes, functions, and objects in the library have external linkage (<a title="basic.link" href="basic.link.html">3.5</a>). The
implementation provides definitions for standard library entities, as necessary, while combining translation units to
form a complete C++ program (<a title="lex.phases" href="lex.phases.html">2.2</a>).</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p7" href="#p7">7</a>Two kinds of implementations are defined: a <dfn>hosted implementation</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="hosted implementation"></object> and a <dfn>freestanding
implementation</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="freestanding
implementation"></object>. For a hosted implementation, this International Standard defines the set of available libraries. A
freestanding implementation is one in which execution may take place without the benefit of an operating system, and has
an implementation-defined set of libraries that includes certain language-support libraries (<a title="compliance" href="compliance.html">17.6.1.3</a>).</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p8" href="#p8">8</a>A conforming implementation may have extensions (including additional library functions), provided they do not
alter the behavior of any well-formed program. Implementations are required to diagnose programs that use such
extensions that are ill-formed according to this International Standard. Having done so, however, they can compile and
execute such programs.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p9" href="#p9">9</a>Each implementation shall include documentation that identifies all conditionally-supported constructs that it
does not support and defines all locale-specific characteristics.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2">2) Correct execution can include undefined behavior, depending on the data being processed; see
<a title="intro.defs" href="intro.defs.html">1.3</a> and <a title="intro.execution" href="intro.execution.html">1.9</a>.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn3">3) This documentation also defines implementation-defined behavior; see <a title="intro.execution" href="intro.execution.html">1.9</a>.</p>
