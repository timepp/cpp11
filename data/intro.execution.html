<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>The semantic descriptions in this International Standard define a parameterized nondeterministic abstract
machine. This International Standard places no requirement on the structure of conforming implementations. In
particular, they need not copy or emulate the structure of the abstract machine. Rather, conforming implementations are
required to emulate (only) the observable behavior of the abstract machine as explained below.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>Certain aspects and operations of the abstract machine are described in this International Standard as
implementation-defined (for example, <code class="sh_cpp">sizeof(int)</code>). These constitute the parameters of the abstract machine.
Each implementation shall include documentation describing its characteristics and behavior in these respects.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> Such documentation shall define the instance of the abstract machine that corresponds to that implementation
(referred to as the “corresponding instance” below).</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>Certain other aspects and operations of the abstract machine are described in this International Standard as
unspecified (for example, order of evaluation of arguments to a function). Where possible, this International Standard
defines a set of allowable behaviors. These define the nondeterministic aspects of the abstract machine. An instance of
the abstract machine can thus have more than one possible execution for a given program and a given input.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p4" href="#p4">4</a>Certain other operations are described in this International Standard as undefined (for example, the effect of
attempting to modify a <code class="sh_cpp">const</code> object). <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> This International Standard imposes no requirements on the
behavior of programs that contain undefined behavior. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p5" href="#p5">5</a>A conforming implementation executing a well-formed program shall produce the same observable behavior as one
of the possible executions of the corresponding instance of the abstract machine with the same program and the same
input. However, if any such execution contains an undefined operation, this International Standard places no requirement
on the implementation executing that program with that input (not even with regard to operations preceding the first
undefined operation).</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p6" href="#p6">6</a>When the processing of the abstract machine is interrupted by receipt of a signal, the values of objects which
are neither</p>

<ul>
<li>of type <code class="sh_cpp">volatile std::sig_atomic_t</code> nor</li>
<li>lock-free atomic objects (<a title="atomics.lockfree" href="atomics.lockfree.html">29.4</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>are unspecified during the execution of the signal handler, and the value of any object not in either of these two
categories that is modified by the handler becomes undefined.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p7" href="#p7">7</a>An instance of each object with automatic storage duration (<a title="basic.stc.auto" href="basic.stc.auto.html">3.7.3</a>) is associated with each entry
into its block. Such an object exists and retains its last-stored value during the execution of the block and while the
block is suspended (by a call of a function or receipt of a signal).</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p8" href="#p8">8</a>The least requirements on a conforming implementation are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Access to volatile objects are evaluated strictly according to the rules of the abstract machine.</li>

<li>At program termination, all data written into files shall be identical to one of the possible results that execution
of the program according to the abstract semantics would have produced.</li>

<li>The input and output dynamics of interactive devices shall take place in such a fashion that prompting output is
actually delivered before a program waits for input. What constitutes an interactive device is
implementation-defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>These collectively are referred to as the <dfn>observable behavior</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="observable behavior"></object> of the program. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> More stringent
correspondences between abstract and actual semantics may be defined by each implementation. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<div class="note">
<p><a class="anchor" id="p9" href="#p9">9</a>[ <em>Note:</em> Operators can be regrouped according to the usual mathematical rules only where the operators really
are associative or commutative.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> For example, in the following fragment</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">int a, b;
/* … */
a = a + 32760 + b + 5;</code></pre>

<p>the expression statement behaves exactly the same as</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">a = (((a + 32760) + b) + 5);</code></pre>

<p>due to the associativity and precedence of these operators. Thus, the result of the sum <code class="sh_cpp">(a + 32760)</code> is
next added to <code class="sh_cpp">b</code>, and that result is then added to <code class="sh_cpp">5</code> which results in the value assigned to
<code class="sh_cpp">a</code>. On a machine in which overflows produce an exception and in which the range of values representable by
an <code class="sh_cpp">int</code> is <code class="sh_cpp">[-32768,+32767]</code>, the implementation cannot rewrite this expression as</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">a = ((a + b) + 32765);</code></pre>

<p>since if the values for <code class="sh_cpp">a</code> and <code class="sh_cpp">b</code> were, respectively, -32754 and -15, the sum <code class="sh_cpp">a +
b</code> would produce an exception while the original expression would not; nor can the expression be rewritten either
as</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">a = ((a + 32765) + b);</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code class="sh_cpp">a = (a + (b + 32765));</code></pre>

<p>since the values for <code class="sh_cpp">a</code> and <code class="sh_cpp">b</code> might have been, respectively, 4 and -8 or -17 and 12. However
on a machine in which overflows do not produce an exception and in which the results of overflows are reversible, the
above expression statement can be rewritten by the implementation in any of the above ways because the same result will
occur. — <em>end note</em> ]</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p10" href="#p10">10</a>A <dfn>full-expression</dfn><object type="application/x-oleobject" classid="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e"><param name="Keyword" value="full-expression"></object> is an expression that is not a subexpression of another expression. If a language
construct is defined to produce an implicit call of a function, a use of the language construct is considered to be an
expression for the purposes of this definition. A call to a destructor generated at the end of the lifetime of an object
other than a temporary object is an implicit full-expression. Conversions applied to the result of an expression in
order to satisfy the requirements of the language construct in which the expression appears are also considered to be
part of the full-expression.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p11" href="#p11">11</a><span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> The evaluation of a full-expression can include the evaluation of subexpressions that are not lexically

<p><a class="anchor" id="p14" href="#p14">14</a>Every value computation and side effect associated with a full-expression is sequenced before every value

computation of the result of the operator. If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either another
side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p>When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline), every value computation and side effect associated
with any argument expression, or with the postfix expression designating the called function, is sequenced before
execution of every expression or statement in the body of the called function. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> Value computations and side effects
associated with different argument expressions are unsequenced. — <em>end note</em> ]</span> Every evaluation in the calling function
(including other function calls) that is not otherwise specifically sequenced before or after the execution of the body
of the called function is indeterminately sequenced with respect to the execution of the called function.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup>
Several contexts in C++ cause evaluation of a function call, even though no corresponding function call syntax appears
in the translation unit. <span class="example">[ <em>Example:</em> Evaluation of a <code class="sh_cpp">new</code> expression invokes one or more allocation and
constructor functions; see <a title="expr.new" href="expr.new.html">5.3.4</a>. For another example, invocation of a conversion function
(<a title="class.conv.fct" href="class.conv.fct.html">12.3.2</a>) can arise in contexts in which no function call syntax appears.  — <em>end example</em> ]</span> The sequencing
constraints on the execution of the called function (as described above) are features of the function calls as
evaluated, whatever the syntax of the expression that calls the function might be.</p>











<div>
<p class="footnote" id="fn5">5) This provision is sometimes called the “as-if” rule, because an implementation is free to disregard any
requirement of this International Standard as long as the result is <em>as if</em> the requirement had been obeyed, as
far as can be determined from the observable behavior of the program. For instance, an actual implementation need not
evaluate part of an expression if it can deduce that its value is not used and that no side effects affecting the
observable behavior of the program are produced.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn6">6) This documentation also includes conditonally-supported constructs and locale-specific behavior. See
<a title="intro.compliance" href="intro.compliance.html">1.4</a>.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn7">7) Overloaded operators are never assumed to be associative or commutative.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn8">8) As specified in <a title="class.temporary" href="class.temporary.html">12.2</a>, after a full-expression is evaluated, a sequence of zero or more
invocations of destructor functions for temporary objects takes place, usually in reverse order of the construction of
each temporary object.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn9">9) In other words, function executions do not interleave with each other.</p>
