program, including the initial invocation of a specific top-level function, and recursively including every function
invocation subsequently executed by the thread. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> When one thread creates another, the initial call to the top-level

can potentially access every object and function in a program.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> Under a hosted implementation, a C++
program can have more than one thread running concurrently. The execution of each thread proceeds as defined by the
remainder of this standard. The execution of the entire program consists of an execution of all of its threads.

operations, for example, allow executions inconsistent with a simple interleaving, as described below. — <em>end note</em> ]</span> Under a

to the rules below. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> In some cases, there may instead be undefined behavior. Much of this section is motivated by
the desire to support atomic operations with explicit and detailed visibility constraints. However, it also implicitly
supports a simpler view for more restricted programs. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p5" href="#p5">5</a>The library defines a number of atomic operations (Clause <a title="atomics" href="atomics.general.html">29</a>) and operations on mutexes (Clause
<a title="thread" href="thread.general.html">30</a>) that are specially identified as synchronization operations. These operations play a special role in
making assignments in one thread visible to another. A synchronization operation on one or more memory locations is
either a consume operation, an acquire operation, a release operation, or both an acquire and release operation. A
synchronization operation without an associated memory location is a fence and can be either an acquire fence, a release
fence, or both an acquire and release fence. In addition, there are relaxed atomic operations, which are not
synchronization operations, and atomic read-modify-write operations, which have special characteristics. <span class="note">[ <em>Note:</em> For
example, a call that acquires a mutex will perform an acquire operation on the locations comprising the mutex.
Correspondingly, a call that releases the same mutex will perform a release operation on those same locations.
Informally, performing a release operation on <var>A</var> forces prior side effects on other memory locations to become
visible to other threads that later perform a consume or an acquire operation on <var>A</var>. “Relaxed” atomic
operations are not synchronization operations even though, like synchronization operations, they cannot contribute to
data races. — <em>end note</em> ]</span></p>

this limitation is that a consume operation participating in a “dependency-ordered before” relationship provides
ordering only with respect to operations to which this consume operation actually carries a dependency. The reason that
this limitation applies only to the end of such a concatenation is that any subsequent release operation will provide
the required ordering for a prior consume operation. The second exception is that a concatenation is not permitted to
consist entirely of “sequenced before”. The reasons for this limitation are (1) to permit “inter-thread happens before”
