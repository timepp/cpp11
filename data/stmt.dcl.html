<p>If an identifier introduced by a declaration was previously declared in an outer block, the outer declaration is
hidden for the remainder of the block, after which it resumes its force.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>It is possible to transfer into a block, but not in a way that bypasses declarations with initialization. A
program that jumps<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn90">90</a></sup> from a point where a variable with automatic storage duration is not in scope to a
point where it is in scope is ill-formed unless the variable has scalar type, class type with a trivial default
constructor and a trivial destructor, a cv-qualified version of one of these types, or an array of one of the preceding
types and is declared without an initializer (<a title="dcl.init" href="dcl.init.html">8.5</a>).</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p4" href="#p4">4</a>The zero-initialization (<a title="dcl.init" href="dcl.init.html">8.5</a>) of all block-scope variables with static storage duration
(<a title="basic.stc.static" href="basic.stc.static.html">3.7.1</a>) or thread storage duration (<a title="basic.stc.thread" href="basic.stc.thread.html">3.7.2</a>) is performed before any other initialization takes
place. Constant initialization (<a title="basic.start.init" href="basic.start.init.html">3.6.2</a>) of a block-scope entity with static storage duration, if applicable,
is performed before its block is first entered. An implementation is permitted to perform early initialization of other
block-scope variables with static or thread storage duration under the same conditions that an implementation is
permitted to statically initialize an object a variable with static or thread storage duration in namespace scope
(<a title="basic.start.init" href="basic.start.init.html">3.6.2</a>). Otherwise such a variable is initialized the first time control passes through its declaration; such
a variable is considered initialized upon the completion of its initialization. If the initialization exits by throwing
an exception, the initialization is not complete, so it will be tried again the next time control enters the
declaration. If control enters the declaration concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent
execution shall wait for completion of the initialization.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn91">91</a></sup> If control re-enters the declaration
recursively while the variable is being initialized, the behavior is undefined.</p>

  static int s = foo(2*i);  // recursive call — undefined
