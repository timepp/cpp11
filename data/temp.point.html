<p><a class="anchor" id="p1" href="#p1">1</a>For a function template specialization, a member function template specialization, or a specialization for a
member function or static data member of a class template, if the specialization is implicitly instantiated because it
is referenced from within another template specialization and the context from which it is referenced depends on a
template parameter, the point of instantiation of the specialization is the point of instantiation of the enclosing
specialization. Otherwise, the point of instantiation for such a specialization immediately follows the namespace scope
declaration or definition that refers to the specialization.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p2" href="#p2">2</a>If a function template or member function of a class template is called in a way which uses the definition of a
default argument of that function template or member function, the point of instantiation of the default argument is the
point of instantiation of the function template or member function specialization.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p3" href="#p3">3</a>For a class template specialization, a class member template specialization, or a specialization for a class
member of a class template, if the specialization is implicitly instantiated because it is referenced from within
another template specialization, if the context from which the specialization is referenced depends on a template
parameter, and if the specialization is not instantiated previous to the instantiation of the enclosing template, the
point of instantiation is immediately before the point of instantiation of the enclosing template. Otherwise, the point
of instantiation for such a specialization immediately precedes the namespace scope declaration or definition that
refers to the specialization.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p4" href="#p4">4</a>If a virtual function is implicitly instantiated, its point of instantiation is immediately following the point
of instantiation of its enclosing class template specialization.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p5" href="#p5">5</a>An explicit instantiation definition is an instantiation point for the specialization or specializations
specified by the explicit instantiation.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p6" href="#p6">6</a>The instantiation context of an expression that depends on the template arguments is the set of declarations
with external linkage declared prior to the point of instantiation of the template specialization in the same
translation unit.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="p7" href="#p7">7</a>A specialization for a function template, a member function template, or of a member function or static data
member of a class template may have multiple points of instantiations within a translation unit, and in addition to the
points of instantiation described above, for any such specialization that has a point of instantiation within the
translation unit, the end of the translation unit is also considered a point of instantiation. A specialization for a
class template has at most one point of instantiation within a translation unit. A specialization for any template may
have points of instantiation in multiple translation units. If two different points of instantiation give a template
specialization different meanings according to the one definition rule (<a title="basic.def.odr" href="basic.def.odr.html">3.2</a>), the program is ill-formed, no
diagnostic required.</p>
